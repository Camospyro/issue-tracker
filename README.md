# Game Jolt Next Issue Tracker

This is the issue tracker for Game Jolt Next! If you're one of the testers feel free to add in bugs and issues as you find them. If you're not a tester with access to Game Jolt Next yet, feel free to look through the issue list to see what's being worked on. It could be fun to follow along!

**Please check to see if the issue is already known about before posting.** I have primed the issue tracker with many known bugs that I'm working through. Because of that, chances are likely that I already know of the issue and logged it, so be sure to do a quick search through the issue list.

**Don't report any issues yet around performance.** I haven't done any performance optimizations yet. Expect jank and lag while switching pages and scrolling. Game pages in particular can get quite heavy at the moment. You may also experience slow page loads in some places. There's a lot still to be done with speeding up the site.
