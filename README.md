# Game Jolt Next Issue Tracker

This is the issue tracker for Game Jolt Next! If you're one of the testers, feel free to add bugs and issues as you find them.

**Please check to see if the issue is already known before posting.** We've primed the issue tracker with many known bugs that we're already working through. If you encounter a bug, there's a good chance we already know of the issue and have logged it, so be sure to do a quick search through the issue list before posting.

**Hold off on reporting issues related to performance.** We haven't done any performance optimizations yet. Expect jank and lag while switching pages and scrolling, and you may experience slow page loads in some places. Game pages in particular can get quite heavy at the moment. There's still a lot to be done as far as speeding up the site.
