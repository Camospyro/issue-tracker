# Game Jolt Next Issue Tracker

This is the issue tracker for Game Jolt Next! Feel free to add any new bugs and issues you find as you come across them.

**Before posting, check to see if an issue is already known.** There are a number of known bugs in the issue tracker already, and we're steadily working through them. If you encounter a bug, it may have already been reported, so do a quick search through the [list of issues](https://github.com/gamejolt/next-issue-tracker/issues) before adding a new issue.

**Don't report any issues related to performance.** Hold off on these for now. We still have a lot of optimization to do, so expect some jank and lag while pages load or when you scroll. In particular, game pages can get quite heavy at the moment. We're still working on speeding up the site.
